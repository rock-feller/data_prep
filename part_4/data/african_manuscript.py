Before the common era, significant civilizations marked the African landscape. The Kingdom of Kush flourished around 1070 BC. Carthage's establishment dates back to 814 BC.
Transitioning to the common era, the Axum Empire's golden age began circa AD 100. The Mali Empire's vast stretches of influence started around AD 1235, with legendary rulers such as Mansa Musa.
Later on, the Songhai Empire dominated the Sahel region from AD 1430. The Rozwi Empire, though lesser-known, was pivotal between AD 1660 and AD 1866.
Zulu Kingdom's fierce resistance against colonial powers in the late AD 1800s remains an emblem of African resilience.
