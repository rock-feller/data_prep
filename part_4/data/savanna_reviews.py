The landscapes were breathtakingly beautiful. We had a wonderful guide who knew a lot about wildlife.
The driving was a bit too long, and sometimes it was tiring.
The camps provided relaxing atmospheres after long drives.
I was amazed by the variety of animals we got to see.
The tour organization could improve; we had delays.
Our guide was knowledgeable, but the vehicle had issues.
The savanna sunsets are unforgettable.
More variety in food would be appreciated.
The zebras and lions were the highlights for me.
Some drives were exhausting; better planning is needed.
The staff at the camps were friendly and helpful.
Overall, it was a journey worth every penny, but minor improvements can make it even better.
